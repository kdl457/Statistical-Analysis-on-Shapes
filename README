Things to write:

- Preliminaries (connections, exponential function, curvature, ...)
	- Exponential function - MADS
	- Defining curvature by geodesics - MADS
- Example of finite dimensional space
- Define variance and mean on fin. dim. space (Intrinsic...)
- Space of immersions + quotient space - ANDERS
- Why does the L^2 metric not work? - ANDERS
- Metrics that work: almost local metrics
- Can we meaningfully define variance and mean on infinite dimensional space
