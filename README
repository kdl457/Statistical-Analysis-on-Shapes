Things to write:

- Preliminaries (connections, exponential funciton, curvature, ...)
- Example of finite dimensional space
- Define variance and mean on fin. dim. space 
- Space of immersions + quotient space
- Why does the L^2 metric not work?
- Metrics that work: almost local metrics
- Can we meaningfully define variance and mean on infinite dimensional space
